### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - The current skills I possess include HTML, 3D design and python. These are technical skills that I have been currently improving in and have been successful in understanding. They have provided me with knowledge on how to build things through code and how these languages affect how code responds to them. 
    - Skills which I feel need improvement include CSS, Javascript and React. Its is important for me to improe on these skills as they ae an integral part in making a wholesome and reactive design. They are important keys in web development because they make the stylings and the responsiveness of the web page. 

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - What I been very interested in is diving deep into full stack web development, in future that is what I see as something that can help set me apart from other web developers. Another one of my key interests include 3D design, in learning three.js I would be coming one step closer into coding 3D designs that promise to create more visual interpretations of things. I have always been insterested in finding a deeper understanding of how people code visualistic 3D designs. I want to grow my presence in development by making sure that all the skills that I possess will have in impact on the future of visual design. 
    - The most important values for me in a work environment is team collaboration and understanding, communication, flexibility, adaptability, honesty and time managememt. These values are a clear indication that I would be a trustworthy person to work with. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Roles that I have researhced include: 
    - Javascript developer, 
    - react.js developer, 
    - mobile application developer, 
    - frontend developer and 
    - software development engineer. 

    - The areas that piqued my interest include frontend development, Javascript and React.js  developer. This seemed very interesting to me because these are paths that i want to improve on and find a stable career in. I am attracted to this type of development becuase I feel that it allows the coder to be creative with their projects, and it requires understanding of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - These roles align with my skills because of their requirements in understanding HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js, which are skills I intend to have a master knowledge of by the end of the program. As a young adult exploring the workings of technology, I became interested on how people (coders) made websites, apps and 3D renderings and how all those things were made to be responsive to different types of screens. Which led me to finding out that all of that was possible through coding. Curiosity and the willingness to learn and find out more information about things is the reason why I am attracted to the tech industry because I feel that as a tech enthusiast you learn something new everyday if you are willing to. 

    - The gap that I want to dive deep into exploring is the intergration of artificial intelligence into technology. I want to know more and understand how I can incorporate that into my development journey and ultimately, my career.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Specific:
        - Goal: Learn a new programming language for example React.js.
        - Rationale: By acquiring proficiency in a specific language, I wanted to expand my skill set, making me more versatile and valuable.
    - Measurable:
        - Goal: Write and deploy three new features using that language by the end of the year.
        - Rationale: Quantifiable progress ensures accountability and motivates me to actively contribute to the product.
    - Achievable:
        - Goal: Complete a certification course in cloud computing within six months.
        - Rationale: This raalistic goal will help me maintain enthusiasm and allow me to enhance my expertise, benefiting both me and the organization.
    - Relevant:
        - Goal: Improve front-end development skills to enhance user experience.
        - Rationale: Aligned with my role as a developer, this goal directly impacts the organizationâ€™s mission by creating better user interfaces.
    - Time-Bound:
        - Goal: Launch the mobile app by the end of 2025.
        - Rationale: A deadline provides focus, allowing evaluation of success and the opportunity to set new goals.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - My long term career plans see me being a full stack developer and eventually a software engineer in one of the world's biggest companies, Amazon. I want to have an offical AWS certification so that I have a credible understanding of cloud computing. 
    
    - This aligns with my goals becuase I have the iante desire to be a cloud computing genius. I have always seen myself  working for the world's biggest companies and making a difference in the tech industry. 

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Steps needed for each short term goal: 
        - Goal 1: start by understanding the fundamentals of HTML, CSS & Javascript, which will inevitably lead to learning React.js effectively.
        - Goal 2: after learning the fundamentals of React.js, I need to make sure that I have a solid understanding of how to deploy functions and features so that I can be able to effectively deploy the new features. 
        - Goal 3: I need to develop a roadmap and take classes in AWS cloud computing, attend workshops and make sure that i practice questions so that I have a claer understanding of what I want to do.
        - Goal 4: Join development challenges, be part of hackerthons and developer marathons and create more frontend projects.
        - Goal 5: Make sure I have a complete understanding of all the requirements of building a mobile app, specifically HTML, CSS, Javascript, React native, bootstrap and angular.

    - Resources include Extra courses such as coursera, Alison, udemy and other free youtube courses. Other important resources may come in a form of mentorship programmes and attending conferences where there are experts that teach these languages and impart knowledge on how to effectively embark on your coding journey. 
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Building the foundation of software development is one of the most important in making sure that I am successful in my long term goals. This foundation of software development will help me easily integrate into software engineering which will allow me to easily understand cloud computing, I want my skills to cascade into each other, where on skill will help uplift the other so that I learn skills that will be able to set me apart from the rest.
    
    - Additional skills that I might need to learn will include React native, SQL, Python & C#, these are skills that will set me apart in terms of technical skills that I possess. Possible qualifications might be venturing into having a traditional degree in computer science and furthermore going into pursuing a masters degree in computer sciences.
