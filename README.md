### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - The current skills I possess include HTML, 3D design and python. These are technical skills that I have been currently improving in and have been successful in understanding. They have provided me with knowledge on how to build things through code and how these languages affect how code responds to them. 
    - Skills which I feel need improvement include CSS, Javascript and React. Its is important for me to improe on these skills as they ae an integral part in making a wholesome and reactive design. They are important keys in web development because they make the stylings and the responsiveness of the web page. 

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - What I been very interested in is diving deep into full stack web development, in future that is what I see as something that can help set me apart from other web developers. Another one of my key interests include 3D design, in learning three.js I would be coming one step closer into coding 3D designs that promise to create more visual interpretations of things. I have always been insterested in finding a deeper understanding of how people code visualistic 3D designs. I want to grow my presence in development by making sure that all the skills that I possess will have in impact on the future of visual design. 
    - The most important values for me in a work environment is team collaboration and understanding, communication, flexibility, adaptability, honesty and time managememt. These values are a clear indication that I would be a trustworthy person to work with. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Roles that I have researhced include: 
    - Javascript developer, 
    - react.js developer, 
    - mobile application developer, 
    - frontend developer and 
    - software development engineer. 

    - The areas that piqued my interest include frontend development, Javascript and React.js  developer. This seemed very interesting to me because these are paths that i want to improve on and find a stable career in. I am attracted to this type of development becuase I feel that it allows the coder to be creative with their projects, and it requires understanding of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - These roles align with my skills because of their requirements in understanding HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js, which are skills I intend to have a master knowledge of by the end of the program. As a young adult exploring the workings of technology, I became interested on how people (coders) made websites, apps and 3D renderings and how all those things were made to be responsive to different types of screens. Which led me to finding out that all of that was possible through coding. Curiosity and the willingness to learn and find out more information about things is the reason why I am attracted to the tech industry because I feel that as a tech enthusiast you learn something new everyday if you are willing to. 

    - The gap that I want to dive deep into exploring is the intergration of artificial intelligence into technology. I want to know more and understand how I can incorporate that into my development journey and ultimately, my career.
